## Want to contribute?

That's awesome, thank you!

Refer [Scarpe in Development](https://github.com/scarpe-team/scarpe#scarpe-in-development) to get started!

You can go ahead an try to fix one of our [issues](https://github.com/scarpe-team/scarpe/issues). or make your own!
if there are any issues, it's not your fault it's mostly likely from our side so please don't hesitate ask anything.

for starters you can try [good first issues](https://github.com/scarpe-team/scarpe/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) which we believe are suitable to get started with contributing for scarpe. These issues either are relatively easy to accomplish or don't depend on a lot of other scarpe code 
(e.g. completely new features) so that it's easier to get started. Please feel free to tackle any issue - we will help you if needed. The tag is just a suggestion!

Also there is a list of samples that already work at `examples`, along with all the other unchecked examples in `examples/legacy/unchecked`. 
You can try to run these to get a feel of things `./exe/scarpe path/to/file.rb --dev`, you can also try running unchecked examples if you want to get your hands dirty!

If you feel unsure about testing or your implementation just open an issue or a pull request. Pull requests don't need to be done - they are great discussion starters! We're happy to help you get your contribution ready to be merged in order to help build Scarpe!

In fact we greatly appreciate early pull requests to review code and help you find your way around things! no a side note dont spam pull requests for discussing unrelated things.

Feel free to drop by on discord to ask anything or just to say hi to us!. People might not respond instantly, but after some time someone will respond :)
