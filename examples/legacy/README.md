# Legacy Projects

These are Shoes examples, taken from a wide variety of sources. In general, we try not to modify them.

It's possible that some of them run but we haven't realised it yet, which is why the "not_checked" directory is nameed that, rather than something like "won't work". Also, they aren't checked by CI, while the ones marked working have to at least boot up.
